<h1 id="23">What I Did Over The Holidays</h1>
<p><a href="video_games/video_games.html">Video Games</a></p> 
  
    <p>I used the time to do my hobbies, video games being one of them. Some video games I played was Stardew Valley but
    most of my time was taken up by Sims 4. I'm forcing these two Sims that are cowboys to have a forbidden queer romance. </p>

    <p>While I was doing my hobbies, I finally started watching Rupaul Drag Race. I did skip to Season 7 so I can see
        Trixie Mattel and Katya. Then I went right back to Season 1 and continued on from there. </p>
